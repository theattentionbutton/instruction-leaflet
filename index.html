            <div>Congratulations on getting your new Attention Button, a desk toy designed to keep you close to your
                loved ones. This leaflet will guide you through setting up and using it.</div>
            <div>Before getting started, head to <u>https://theattentionbutton.in</u> and create an account.</div>
            <div>We hope you have as much fun using this as we did making it.</div>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Log in to the Attention Button website and create a room. Also invite your partner to the room by
                    giving their e-mail address.
                    Note down the <strong>room secret</strong> here.</li>
                <li>Connect your Attention Button to power via the supplied USB cable.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Configuration</strong> icon should appear on the display.</li>
                <li>You should be able to see a Wi-Fi network titled <strong>"AttentionButtonSetup"</strong> on any
                    nearby Wi-Fi-capable device.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="page" id="page-4">
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Connect to it. If the setup page does not launch automatically, navigate to <u>http://4.3.2.1</u> in
                    your device browser.</li>
                <li>Enter your Wi-Fi details, e-mail, and the room phrase from Step 1 here.</li>
                <li>Repeat Steps 2-6 on the partner device, using their e-mail. Save and exit.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The configuration menu is also where you perform software updates, and you will need to come back here
                to update the Wi-Fi details. To re-enter the configuration menu for these purposes, power off the
                Attention Button, then hold down the knob while powering it on again.</p>
